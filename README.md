# Purpose  

This project documents my attempt to create a local, home based, kubernetes platform. The sub-folders are different approachs I've taken.  

Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2 (RKE2) was my first attempt. I got everything set up but I believe the old computers I'm using for my nodes were not able to maintain the deployment.   

Microk8s is my second attempt.
